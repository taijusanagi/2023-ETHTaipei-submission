## Description

Verified Anonymous provides verification with POAP and protects user privacy with Semaphore.

### Benefit

This innovative approach offers the following key benefits:

#### Reviewers

- Can give honest feedback while remaining anonymous
- Verification ensures authenticity of reviews

#### Viewers

- Read honest reviews from verified users, providing greater trust and confidence in the feedback

### How it works

![how-it-works](./docs/how-it-works.png)

- Event organizers can now register their events using a POAP
- Users can authenticate their attendance with POAP and submit privacy-protected reviews using the Semaphore
- Only targeted POAP users can join the group
- The signal is visible to everyone, but the actual sender remains hidden with Semaphore
